## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to customize my experience and add notes.
- As a user, I want to have something that is easy to reference and update.

## Models

The database schema I'll be aiming to use is leveraging the PostgreSQL that it currently uses. The schema is going to look something like this:

I allow users to add items to the database for all users to use, or if users want they can further edit and add notes to their personally made list.
